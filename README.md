## ðŸ“œ Description:

Predictor is a web application that uses machine learning to predict potato leaf diseases. It is designed to identify whether a potato plant is healthy, affected by early blight, or affected by late blight based on the images of its leaves. The application utilizes ReactJS for the frontend, FastAPI for building APIs on the backend, and Python for model creation and training. The machine learning models are built using libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and Keras. The application is hosted using Cloudflare and the backend is hosted on Render.com.


## ðŸ¤© Features:

- Web-based application accessible from any device with a browser.
- Prediction of potato leaf diseases: healthy, early blight, and late blight.
- User-friendly interface.
- Fast and accurate predictions.
- Easy-to-understand prediction results.
- Upload Images using - URL or Local Images.


## ðŸŒŽ Deployed Website (Frontend) & (Backend):

[Frontend](https://leaf-predictor.pages.dev) & [Backend](https://leaf-predictor.onrender.com)

**Note:** The backend server may take up to **15 minutes** to boot up if it has been shut down due to inactivity on the free tier pack provided by render.com. Please be patient and wait for a few minutes to receive the results for the first time. Once the server is up and running, subsequent requests will yield results almost instantly. Enjoy using the application!
